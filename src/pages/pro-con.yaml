  content: |
    I taught myself to program. The vast majority of my knowledge and
    techniques are either from library books, or random internet searches.
    I have absolutely no idea what I am talking about most of the time,
    and anything I say should be taken with a grain of salt of significant
    size.

- title: ANOTHER DISCLAIMER
  content: |
    I don't know C, or C+, or C++, or C#, or C*, or Cg, or D, or E (all of
    those are real programming languages, according to Wikipedia). I also
    have no pressing need to learn any or all of the above any time soon.
    I do use Debian linux, if that helps (if you don't know what that is,
    you are not going to understand my explanation, sorry).

- title: YET ANOTHER DISCLAIMER THAT I UNFORTUNATELY HAVE TO INCLUDE.
  content: |
    I don't use LLMs to write code. Depending on what kind of person you are,
    you either agree with me, or will deny any evidence I present (or just not
    care, shame on you).

    This is NOT a ranked list of the "best" programming languages (depending
    on who you ask, either some variant of C or python would be at the top of
    said list). I firmly believe there is no "best" programming language,
    especially if you factor in the particular scenario (e.g. python is not
    good for making a game in a browser (I learned that the hard way)).
    Instead I am going to provide a list of (what I think) are the pros and
    cons of each language.
