    I taught myself to program. The vast majority of my knowledge and
    techniques are either from library books, or random internet searches.
    I have absolutely no idea what I am talking about most of the time,
    and anything I say should be taken with a grain of salt of significant
    size.

    This is NOT a ranked list of the "best" programming languages (depending
    on who you ask, either some variant of C or python would be at the top of
    said list). I firmly believe there is no "best" programming language,
    especially if you factor in the particular scenario (e.g. python is not
    good for making a game in a browser (I learned that the hard way)).
    Instead I am going to provide a list of (what I think) are the pros and
    cons of each language.

    Without any further ado:

    For the record, the comic is slightly out of date. The print statement is
    only valid in python 2. In python 3 (the version that I know), it would be:

    This is still ludicrously simple compared to some other languages I might
    mention (Java). Python was the first text-based program language I
    learned, so I <i>might</i> be a little bit biased, but it is easy to learn,
    and very extensible (there is quite literally a library for everything).
    It is also object-oriented, though in a rather cursed way. It also completely
    lacks access modifiers outside of naming conventions and name mangling.
  defs:
    - term: object-oriented
      meaning: |
        Object Oriented Programming (or OOP for short) is a rather advanced way
        of structuring code that is rather powerful. Instead of there being
        one giant "application" that stores all of the data and all of the code,
        it instead splits everything up into "objects", which are defined in
        "classes". Java is entirely object-oriented, while others - such as Python
        - it is optional.
    - term: name mangling
      meaning: |
        The less said about it the better. It's a horribly hacked together solution
        to a problem that could have been solved in a better way.

- content: |
    It also has issues with performance, considering that it's an interpreted
    language, which allows for some rather "interesting" tricks. It is a good
    language for starting out, but has some quirks that make it a little
    painful for someone who likes consistency in how things work.
  defs:
    - term: interpreted language
      meaning: |
        When a computer runs a program written in an interpreted language, it "parses"
        (figures out what the instruction says to do) when it reaches that line of
        code. For a number of rather technical reasons, this method is slower than
        "compiled" languages (such as Java and Typescript (which technically
        compiles to Javascript, which is in itself a Just In Time (JIT) language,
        where the computer compiles a line of code the first time it is called)),
        where the code is converted into instructions that can run directly on
        the processor.

    Beware the circular imports!

    I have only started learning Java this year, for the AP Computer Science
    Applications elective. It's... ok.

    Remember how simple the Python "Hello World" program was? Here is the exact
    same thing in Java:

    In Java, OOP is not recommended, its mandatory. Everything is a class (or
    an interface, or an enum, all of which are still just classes). It is also
    a compiled language, which means there are no circular import errors, and it
    can run terrifyingly fast, but also is rather restrictive. Typing is also
    mandatory, constructors don't inherit, and functions with optional arguments
    have to be redefined for each possible case.

- content: |
    It also feels like every time I start to get used to its quirks, it throws
    another one at me. For example, the default modulo operator (%) does not
    do what it should with negative numbers. At all. Use
    java.lang.Math.floorMod() instead.

        Ask a math teacher if you don't remember from eighth grade.

    Remember Desmos?

    It's just a graphing calculator, right? The one embedded in the math
    MCAS? Definitely not Turing complete?

    (to any school administrator who is scared by this, don't worry, it
    takes more time, energy, and knowledge of the material to do this
    than to just solve the problem. The above graph was just something
    I made to help me do my algebra homework last year.)

- content: |
    Considering that Desmos only "recently" (I say "recently", it was
    actually over six months ago) added recursion, working with it is
    not for the faint of heart. Documentation (at least any that I
    can find) does not exist, so most of what I know I taught myself
    by reverse-engineering graphs made by other people.
  defs:
    - term: recursion
      meaning: |
        A function calling itself. Fun fact: if you Google "recursion",
        it will say "did you mean 'recursion'?".

- content: |
    A few of it's limitations include: you can't nest lists, lists
    are limited to 10000 items, it inherits the Javascript floating
    point imprecision nonsense, and it is not very performant (
    especially on Chromebooks). On the other hand:

    My response is: "always, though you will probably never notice"
