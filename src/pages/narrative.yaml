- title: Don't ask about the teapot

    There is no teapot. The teapot does not spin as you scroll the page. Speaking
    of scrolling the page, the text does not do something weird as you do so. You
    are just seeing things. This was made in a perfectly normal way in Google Sites.

    Before you drive yourself insane trying to replicate this,this was not
    (entirely) made in google sites. This whole project is a culmination of
    several of my particular skill sets, and my mess of poorly documented by
    heavily type-checked spaghetti code is probably inscrutable to everyone
    but me. Here's a sample:

    Honestly, that is not even the worse one. It's not even a tsx file. The code
    in question handles the rendering of [NO TEAPOTS WHATSOEVER] on background of
    the site. I'm making use of a library called THREE.js for the actual 3D rendering,
    as the actual math and algorithms that go into 3D graphics go well over my head.
    All the file (technically the class contained within) does is setup the rendering
    loop and handle the camera motion between pages. Also, the glitch postprocessing
    effect is intentional.

    Without any further ado:

    If you don't get the joke in the comic above (or know what git is, but the two
    are generally synonymous), then there is no way I can possibly explain what I
    did in any meaningful way that you will understand. I am sorry. All of my attempts
    so far at doing so have wound up with "too many technical words". The way I brought a number of different concepts together (React,
    THREE, vite, Github CI, yaml, etc.) in this makes it impossible (I really wish I
    could use italics) for me to explain how they all work together <i>without</i>
    (see?) a highly technical explanation. The best example of this that I can think
    of is to ask someone who's first language is English (and who is not an English
    major) for the definition of "adnoun".

    (That wasn't really the best analogy but your reaction was too funny to pass up;
    Alternatively, try "hyponym", which is probably a better comparison).

    With that out of the way, here is my best shot at doing what I just said was impossible:

    As with most things on the internet, it starts with a HTML file. This HTML file, 
    to be specific:

- fig: html

- content: |
    This is the file from the source code, not the actual production site (read: the one
    you are currently looking at). This is for a number of reasons (which I am not going
    to be able to explain), but topographically not much is different.

    Also, there was no teapot.
