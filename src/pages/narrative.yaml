    (A disclaimer before we begin: To anyone who actually understands some or all
    of the concepts I am about to butcher explaining, please understand that I was
    asked to make all of my rather simplified explanations of said things even more
    simplistic. Sorry.)

- title: Don't ask about the teapot
  content: |
    There is no teapot. The teapot does not spin as you scroll the page. Speaking
    of scrolling the page, the text does not do something weird as you do so. You
    are just seeing things. This was made in a perfectly normal way in Google Sites.

    Before you drive yourself insane trying to replicate this, this was not
    (entirely) made in Google Sites. This whole project is a culmination of
    several of my particular skill sets, and my mess of poorly (completely
    un)documented but heavily type-checked (one of the reasons that typescript
    is infinitely better) spaghetti code is probably inscrutable to everyone but
    me. Here's a sample:

    Honestly, that is not even the worst one. It's not even a tsx file. The code
    in question handles the rendering of [NO TEAPOTS WHATSOEVER] on background of
    the site. I'm making use of a library called THREE.js for the actual 3D rendering,
    as the actual math and algorithms that go into 3D graphics go well over my head.
    All the file (technically the class contained within) does is setup the rendering
    loop and handle the camera motion between pages. Also, the glitch postprocessing
    effect is intentional.

    Without any further ado:

    Unfortunately, the above comic is accurate. Then there is no way I can possibly
    explain what I did in any meaningful way without you requesting that I give a
    simpler explanation. Believe me, I've tried. Unfortunately (apparently)
    all of my attempts so far at doing so have wound up with "too many technical
    words". The way I brought a number of different concepts together (React, THREE,
    vite, Github CI, YAML, etc.) in this makes it impossible (I really wish I could
    use italics) for me to explain how they all work together <i>without</i> (see?)
    a highly technical explanation. The best example of this that I can think of is
    to ask someone who's first language is English (and who is not an English major)
    for the definition of "adnoun".

    (That wasn't really the best example but your reaction was too funny to pass up;
    Alternatively, try "hyponym", which probably makes for a better analogy).

    With that out of the way, here is my best shot at doing what I just said was
    impossible:
  content: |
    As with most things on the internet, it starts with a HTML file. This HTML file, 
    to be specific:

- fig: html

- content: |
    This is the file from the source code, not the actual production site (read: the one
    you are currently looking at). This is for a number of reasons (which I am not going
    to be able to explain), but topographically not much is different. I am using a tool
    called "vite" (which is French for "fast", which is its own translation) to pack
    the actual project files into a much more compact (and therefore faster to load over
    the internet) form. This form is then automatically uploaded to a different site,
    which the Google Site (which is probably the one you are looking at right now) is
    merely mirroring. Leave out a bunch of iframe caching issues (I blame Google), and
    I have a way to deploy a custom [NON-TEAPOT] to Google Sites.

- content: |
    The actual content of the site is actually rendered with React, which is a
    Javascript (but Typescript-compatible) framework for creating webpages (in other
    words, a form of self-torture). I understand what is going on in the following
    file, but I doubt any explanation on my part will help you do so:

    This seven-line file kicks off this entire site, as it is technically single-page.
    A little bit "deeper" (but outside of the part that handles switching between
    "pages"), the whole background rendering engine gets initialized, which you saw
    at the start of this "narrative".

- content: |
    There is quite a lot going on still that I have neglected to mention, including
    the fact that all of the text you are looking at is actually stored in a YAML
    file, which allows me to pull this trick:

    If you guessed that was the aforementioned YAML file for this document, you
    would be correct. I wound up implementing the YAML loading system because
    I wanted something a little more readable than pure JSX (if you don't know
    what that is, all you need to know is that you can't read it), but parsing
    markdown with Typescript is a whole can of worms I don't want to even think
    about (though I did check if it was possible).

    Given that this is for an "Informational Writing" course, and I have provided the
    information in a form that people can (hopefully) understand, I suppose it is
    time to wrap this up and commit.

- content: |
    (I'm not an idiot, of course I've been committing this whole time. It just
    triggers the 'build and publish' CI workflow. It also only took two commits to
    set said workflow up, when it normally takes double digits. I'm getting better
    at that, too)

    Also, not one teapot is on this site.

    I assure you...

    ...there are several hundred.
