- title: Don’t ask about the teapot

    There is no teapot. The teapot does not spin as you scroll the page. Speaking of scrolling the page, the text does not do something weird as you do so. You are just seeing things. This was made in a perfectly normal way in Google Sites.

    Before you drive yourself insane trying to replicate this,this was not
    (entirely) made in google sites. This whole project is a culmination of
    several of my particular skill sets, and my mess of poorly documented by
    heavily type-checked spaghetti code is probably inscrutable to everyone
    but me. Here's a sample:

    Honestly, that is not even the worse one. It's not even a tsx file. The code
    in question handles the rendering of [NO TEAPOTS WHATSOEVER] on background of
    the site. I'm making use of a library called THREE.js for the actual 3D rendering,
    as the actual math and algorithms that go into 3D graphics go well over my head.
    All that file (technically the class contained within) does is setup the rendering
    loop and handle the camera motion between pages.

    Also, there was no teapot.
