- title: Don’t ask about the teapot
  content: |
    There is no teapot. The teapot does not spin as you scroll the page. Speaking
    of scrolling the page, the text does not do something weird as you do so. You
    are just seeing things. This was made in a perfectly normal way in Google Sites.

    Before you drive yourself insane trying to replicate this,this was not
    (entirely) made in google sites. This whole project is a culmination of
    several of my particular skill sets, and my mess of poorly documented by
    heavily type-checked spaghetti code is probably inscrutable to everyone
    but me. Here's a sample:

    Honestly, that is not even the worse one. It's not even a tsx file. The code
    in question handles the rendering of [NO TEAPOTS WHATSOEVER] on background of
    the site. I'm making use of a library called THREE.js for the actual 3D rendering,
    as the actual math and algorithms that go into 3D graphics go well over my head.
    All the file (technically the class contained within) does is setup the rendering
    loop and handle the camera motion between pages. Also, the glitch postprocessing
    effect is intentional.

    If you don't get the joke in the comic above (or know what git is, but the two
    are generally synonymous), then there is no way I can possibly explain what I
    did in any meaningful way that you will understand. I am sorry. All of my attempts
    so far at doing so have wound up with "too many technical words". The best example
    of this that I can think of is to ask someone who's first language is English (who
    is not an English major) for the definition of "adnoun".

    Jokes aside, the only way that I can really describe the way I made this is with
    the preceding paragraph. The way I brought a number of different concepts together
    (React, THREE, vite, Github CI, iframes, etc.) in this makes it impossible (I really wish
    I could use italics) for me to explain how they all work together <i>without</i>
    (see?) a highly technical explanation.

    With that out of the way, here is my best shot at doing what I just said was impossible:

    foo

    Also, there was no teapot.
