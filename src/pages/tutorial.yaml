    Python is probably the best language to learn programming with.
    A possible alternative is lua, but I am much more confident with
    Python, so that is what we are going to use.

- title: Running Python
  content: |
    You can write all the code you want and nothing will happen without an interpreter.
    Python is an interpreted language (see the <a href="./#/pro-con">pro/con</a> section
    on it for a definition of "interpreted language"), which means your computer has no
    idea what to do with the code you write unless python is installed. I would recommend
    <a target="_blank" href="https://python.org">the official python.org site</a> to
    download the installer for either mac or Windows (if you are on linux, I trust you
    to know what to do). I will add that this does not work on chromebooks (I would not
    wish my setup on anyone). You will also need a text editor for actually writing code.
    There are plenty of ones out there, but for beginners I would recommend IDLE, which
    ships with the official python installer.

    As to actually <i>running</i> python, you need to open up a command prompt (start menu
    + "cmd" on Windows, who knows what on OSX and I trust linux users to know what do do).
    Then run the "python" command, followed by the path to the file.

- title: Time for some code

    Let's start with a basic "hello world" program. This should write the text "Hello, World!"
    to the console when run.

- fig: helloworld

    If that did not write "Hello, World!", something has gone wrong, and it is up to you
    to fix the problem. Sorry.

    Now lets try to take some user input and echo it back.
  defs:
    - term: echo
      meaning: |
        Send back the same input it was given.

- fig: echo

- content: |
    If you run that program, you should initially get just a "> " prompt on the console.
    If you write some text, then press enter, it should echo your text back at you.

    This is also a sample of string concatenation, or adding two strings together
    with a "+" operator.

- content: |
    To cap off the tutorial, we are going to jump straight into making a encryption
    program. All it is going to do is flip the direction of the input text. I am going
    to explain the concepts required as they come up.

- fig: variable

- content: |
    Already the first line introduces a new concept. This is a variable. A variable is
    a way of storing information for access and manipulation later. In this case,
    the variable is called "plaintext", and we store the user input in there.
