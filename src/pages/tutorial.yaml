    Python is probably the best language to learn programming with.
    A possible alternative is lua, but I am much more confident with
    Python, so that is what we are going to use.

- title: Running Python
  content: |
    You can write all the code you want and nothing will happen without an interpreter.
    Python is an interpreted language (see the <a href="./#/pro-con">pro/con</a> section
    on it for a definition of "interpreted language"), which means your computer has no
    idea what to do with the code you write unless python is installed. I would recommend
    <a target="_blank" href="https://python.org">the official python.org site</a> to
    download the installer for either mac or Windows (if you are on linux, I trust you
    to know what to do). I will add that this does not work on chromebooks (I would not
    wish my setup on anyone). You will also need a text editor for actually writing code.
    There are plenty of ones out there, but for beginners I would recommend IDLE, which
    ships with the official python installer.

    As to actually <i>running</i> python, you need to open up a command prompt (start menu
    + "cmd" on Windows, who knows what on OSX and I trust linux users to know what do do).
    Then run the "python" command, followed by the path to the file.

- title: Time for some code
  content: |
    Let's start with a basic "hello world" program. This should write the text "Hello, World!"
    to the console when run.

- fig: helloworld

- content: |
    If that did not write "Hello, World!", something has gone wrong, and it is up to you
    to fix the problem. Sorry.

    Now lets try to take some user input and echo it back.
  defs:
    - term: echo
      meaning: |
        Send back the same input it was given.

- fig: echo

- content: |
    If you run that program, you should initially get just a "> " prompt on the console.
    If you write some text, then press enter, it should echo your text back at you.

    This is also a sample of string concatenation, or adding two strings together
    with a "+" operator.

- content: |
    To cap off the tutorial, we are going to jump straight into making a encryption
    program. All it is going to do is flip the direction of the input text. I am going
    to explain the concepts required as they come up.

- fig: variable

- content: |
    Already the first line introduces a new concept. This is a variable. A variable is
    a way of storing information for access and manipulation later. In this case,
    the variable is called "plaintext", and we store the user input in there.

- fig: loop

- content: |
    The next line sets the new "output" variable to an empty string (""). The value
    of "output" will be changed later.

- content: |
    The next line is a loop. In this particular case, it is used to iterate through each character
    in the "plaintext" variable, and execute each line of code that is indented after
    it. It runs the code with the "character" variable set to the current character in
    the "plaintext" variable.

- content: |
    The indented line of text executes for each character in "plaintext". Each time it does,
    it sets the value of the "output" variable to the current character in the value of "plaintext"
    plus the previous value of "output". This has the effect of putting each character
    in front of all the characters that came before it. In other words, it just reverses
    the value of "plaintext" into "output".

- fig: cipher

- content: |
    Even though we have the final, encoded, string stored in "output", we need to show it to the user.
    Hence, we just print the value of "output". With that, you have a fully functional
    python program that flips the input text.
