    To (mis)interpret Alan Turing, there is no wrong way to do computer
    science. This is about as true as "there is no such thing a as a stupid
    question" (I can think of a few off of the top of my head), and everyone
    has their own workflow they are comfortable with (which is no indication
    of whether or not the workflow makes <i>sense</i> to anyone but them, don't
    ask about mine). There are, however, a few constants that it is worth it to
    have.

    In my experience, most people's reaction to me mentioning linux is "what is that".
    Actually explaining would (a) take a long time, and (b) the above comic is accurate.
    It's a family of operating systems (think Windows but not spyware, and it requires far
    less resources to install and use). Most linux distros are open-source and developed
    by a lot of people in their free time. It falls into the UNIX family of operating systems
    (which includes MacOS). It does take a <i>little</i> experience to use, though.
